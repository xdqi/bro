===================
# Introduction
One project in Rust that allows users to choose their web browser when clicking a link is [bro](https://github.com/xdqi/bro).

`bro` is a command-line utility that allows users to open links in their preferred web browser. It is designed to be a simple and lightweight alternative to similar utilities like `xdg-open`.

To use `bro`, users can simply type `bro <link>` in their terminal, and bro will prompt them to choose their preferred web browser from a list of installed browsers. They can then select their desired browser and `bro` will open the link in that browser.

`bro` is a good choice for users who want a lightweight and customizable way to open links in their preferred web browser from the command line.
